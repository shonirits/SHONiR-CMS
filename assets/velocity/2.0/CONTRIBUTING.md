**Contributing**

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Velocity before reporting a bug.

- If you are asking for help please use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/velocity.js), as the issue tracker is for bugs and suggestions.

- Unless you're reporting an obvious bug that can be immediately recreated by anyone, please **create a demo** with the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce your bug. You can use [this template](https://jsfiddle.net/Rycochet/mqv9L27u/), which already has Velocity and jQuery included (jQuery is not required by Velocity, it is included for ease of examples).

- Pull Requests for fixes and new features are often accepted, but feel free to open an issue first if you're unsure of the reception. All code submitted becomes part of VelocityJS and gets covered by its [license](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

- Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/wiki).
